## Troubleshooting

### "pdftoppm is not recognized..."
- Make sure you added `C:\Program Files\poppler\Library\bin` to PATH (not just `C:\Program Files\poppler`)
- Restart your terminal/VS Code after adding to PATH

### "Access denied" when creating folder
- Create the folder in a different location, e.g., `C:\poppler`
- Then add `C:\poppler\Library\bin` to PATH instead

### Still not working?
- Verify the path exists: Check that `C:\Program Files\poppler\Library\bin\pdftoppm.exe` file exists
- Try using the full path in terminal: `"C:\Program Files\poppler\Library\bin\pdftoppm.exe" -h`

## What Works Without Poppler?

Even without Poppler, these conversions work:
- âœ… Office files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) â†’ PDF
- âœ… PDF â†’ Word (.docx)
- âœ… PDF â†’ Excel (.xlsx) - requires Java

Only **PDF â†’ PowerPoint** requires Poppler.
